# Monitoring NGSI Adapter
The adapter exposes a RESTful, resource-oriented API accessed via HTTP/HTTPS.
Each resource represents a kind of monitoring **probe** recognized by this
component (from a predefined and extensible list of supported probes). By means
of **parsers** associated to the probes, raw monitoring data is transformed into
the [NGSI][NGSI_ref] representation.

[NGSI_ref]:

"NGSI Context Management"


## Probe resources [/{probe}?id={id}&type={type}]

The set of supported monitoring probes determines the resources of this
RESTful API.

### Transform raw monitoring data from a probe [POST]
Adapter processes requests asynchronously, indicating in the response status
code whether `probe` is recognized (status `200`) or not (`404`).

In case of known probes, adapter transforms data into NGSI and invokes the
[updateContext][updateContext_ref] operation of **Context Broker**.
