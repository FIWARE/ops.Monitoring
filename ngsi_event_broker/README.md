# NGSI Event Broker

Nagios event broker ([NEB][NEB_ref]) module to forward plugin data to
[NGSI Adapter][NGSI_Adapter_ref]. Currently, the broker is particularized for
[XIFI][XIFI_ref] monitoring:

* *ngsi_event_broker_xifi* to process plugin executions for XIFI

## Installation

The module is an architecture-dependent compiled shared object distributed as
a single library bundled in a Debian (.deb) or RedHat (.rpm) package. Assuming
FI-WARE package repositories are configured, just use the proper tool (such as
`apt-get` or `rpm`) to install `fiware-monitoring-ngsi-event-broker` package.
Currently, packages for these distributions are released:

* Ubuntu 12.04 LTS

As an alternative, module can be compiled from sources, either downloaded from
sources repository or as [source code tarball][fiware_monitoring_releases_ref].
First option requires *autotools* and *libtool* to be installed, in order to
generate configuration script

    $ mkdir m4
    $ autoreconf --install

Once `configure` script is generated (or downloaded as part of source tarball),
follow these steps:

    $ ./configure
    $ make
    $ make check
    $ sudo make install

Default target directory for this manual installation is Nagios libdir (usually
`/usr/lib/nagios` or `/usr/lib64/nagios`) and requires sudoer privileges. This
can be changed by running `./configure --libdir=target_libdir`.

## Usage

Nagios should be instructed to load this module on startup. First, stop Nagios
service and then edit configuration file at `/etc/nagios/nagios.cfg` to add the
new broker module with its arguments: the id of the [region][region_ref] that
current infrastructure belongs to, and the endpoint of NGSI Adapter component to
request:

    event_broker_options=-1
    broker_module=/path/ngsi_event_broker_xifi.so -r region -u http://host:port

The module will use such information given as arguments together with data taken
from the [Nagios service definition][nagios_service_ref] to issue a request to
NGSI Adapter. In many cases, service definitions need no modifications and the
broker just works transparently once Nagios is restarted. But there are some
scenarios requiring slight changes in those service definitions (see below).

Once main configuration file and service definitions have been reviewed, then
start Nagios service. Check log files for module initialization (may fail for
missing arguments, for example). Also check that requests are sent to Adapter
server in response to plugin executions.

#### Service definitions

Assuming this Nagios host definition:

    define host{
        use                     linux-server
        host_name               myhostname
        alias                   linux_server
        address                 192.168.0.2
        }

then a typical Nagios service definition would look like this:

    define service{
        use                     generic-service
        host_name               myhostname
        service_description     my service description
        check_command           check_name!arguments
        ...
        }

Depending on the entities being monitored (thus depending on the kind of plugins
used), some of these data items are taken and some additional may be required.
Requests to NGSI Adapter issued by this broker will all follow the pattern
`http://{host}:{port}/{check_name}?id={region}:{uniqueid}&type={type}`, where:

* `http://{host}:{port}` is the endpoint taken from broker arguments
* `{check_name}` is taken from Nagios command specified at service definition
* `{region}` is taken from broker arguments
* `{uniqueid}` is taken from service definition, depending on the command plugin
* `{type}` is also taken from service definition, also depending on the command

For *SNMP monitoring* a Nagios command named `check_snmp` should be used. Entity
type `interface` is assumed by default and `{uniqueid}` consist of the address
and port number given as command arguments (see `check_snmp` manpage). Entity id
in requests would be `{region}:{ifaddr}/{ifport}`

For *host service monitoring* there are no restrictions on the command names and
the plugins to be used. The `{uniqueid}` consist of the hostname and description
of the service, resulting an entity id `{region}:{hostname}:{servicedesc}`.
However, the exact entity type must be explicitly given with a custom variable
`_entity_type` at service definition (or using templates, as follows):

    define service{
        use                     generic-service
        name                    host-service
        _entity_type            host_service
        }

    define service{
        use                     host-service
        host_name               myhostname
        service_description     my service description
        check_command           check_name!arguments
        ...
        }

For *any other plugin executed locally* the entity id will include the local
address and a `host` entity type will be assumed, resulting a request like
`http://{host}:{port}/{check_name}?id={region}:{localaddr}&type=host`

For *any other plugin executed remotely via NRPE* the entity id will include
the remote address instead, a `vm` entity type will be assumed and the
`{check_name}` will be taken from arguments of `check_nrpe` plugin

Default entity types may be superseded in any case by including in the service
definition the aforementioned custom variable `_entity_type`.
